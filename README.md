## Summary

Wandering the post-human wastes in search of a soul to entertain, WURMLO1D [B0BB1T] is a robot erratically searching for purpose! Its voice is often heard singing in ruins as they look for someone they deem worthy of its song. Bobbit’s voice is full of both sugar and spice. And perhaps something that smells a bit like copper. But you can’t smell through the screen, silly. So Bobbit says you have nothing to worry about! :3 Let them make friends with all the vocalists in your singers folder! They don’t bite… Hard!

As well as the language tags there are a few extra phonemes available to use across all languages:

| Phoneme | Name | Usage |

| cl | Plosive Modifier | This can be used after consonants to reign in their pronunciation a bit. |
| q | Glottal Stop | uh-oh [ah q ow] |
| vf | Vocal Fry | This can be added before vowels, and some consonants, paired with a low pitch curve/point, to add vocal fry |

The following phonemes are extras for the English language natively supported by the "DIFFS-EN+" phonemizer:
